    "survey_story": "As a pastor and parent, internet access is crucial to work and education. In my work, I have often been able to serve others who have no internet access nor transportation through applying online for jobs, printing important online documents, and connecting them with services. In education, especially during this time of social isolation, I have homeschooled my three children using the wonderful education resources available online. I honestly don’t know how families, who are already economically burdened, are able to be successful without internet access in this day and time. Internet access is no longer a “convenience” but an integral part of our society in how we apply, educate and network.",

There’s a lot of static on the phone line, which causes calls to drop. This is a definite risk to the safety of my Mom.\n\n\n\nThe same is true for our alarm system. We pay the same price for ADT as a customer who has high speed internet but we get none of the benefits of an internet connection. DSL is too slow to permit online access.\n\n\n\nCentryLink will not replace the DSL in our area with better technology. The cost outweighs the satisfaction of its customers. The very fact that it can take TWO WEEKS to get onsite technical repair when our internet is down says it all. If I had understood how bad the service and customer support is from CenturyLink before we bought this house, I might have reconsidered.",

And I will potentially be losing this ISP soon as they are getting out of using 900mhz wireless which we are dependent on.  \n\n\n\nAs to the question: Are you satisfied with the performance of your connection for the price that you pay per month?\n\n\n\nI put No, but it is really \"kind of\".  I am satisfied given the circumstances.  If AT&T would bring their service another quarter mile, or the local cable company would bring theirs another 300 feet, then no, I would not be satisfied with what we get for what we pay.  I guess what I am saying, it is better then nothing.  That being said, Skyrunner as a company is wonderful.  I would willingly pay more to continue to do business with them as long as their service provided was competitive.",

I have to supplement this terribly slow DSL connection from Frontier with satellite internet through Viasat. With satellite, I have a 12gb data cap per month. Once I go over this, the speed is slower than Frontier, which as you can see below, is .76 mbps. Satellite can get as bad as .2 mbps. Satellite also goes out when it rains and storms, which in my area is nearly half the year. I pay over $100 a month for internet through these two providers. A recent FCC complaint we filed against Frontier has gotten their attention, and we are finally talking to some higher up people in the company. We were told we were going to be upgraded to 9 mbps, but this was quickly shut down when the technician told us we are too far away from a terminal. We are continuing with the FCC complaint but we seriously doubt at this point that anything is going to improve.",

Unfortunately, I did not realize I could not get better service here until after buying the house. While less important, I was an avid gamer but the high latency associated with satellite internet has made my hobby impossible. The Viasat company has very nice phone support but their service is horrible, especially for the price. I never get the advertised speeds. They promised up to 25 mbps, and they mostly delivered at first.  But now they no longer advertise 25 mbps (website shows 12 mbps). I'm lucky to get 5 to 10 mbps during the day. In the evenings, the speed often drops to 1 to 3 mbps. The upload speed is also extremely slow. It's so bad, often not even GIFs will load. It seems I live in a dead zone; there is DSL/fiber a few miles one way and cable internet a few miles the other way, but no options here. I even tried using a cell signal booster, but the mountains block the signal to towers nearby. I can only connect to a tower very far away. So even though it seems I have 4G cell service, it is only good for calls but does not work for data.",

It would be fantastic to have more affordable choices! Since I went from 2.4ghz to 5ghz,my home phone hasn't worked in over year now. Too complicated to call and get help.

I was told the more devices that are connected the lower the speed so that is why I opted to pay for the highest speed they had at the time. I was also told since I am paying for 300 Mbs I am only getting half of that amount because of the amount of devices that I have connected. I don't feel that is okay! If I am paying for 300 Mbs then that is what I should be receiving no matter what! Now they are offering 1 TB and above of internet speed but you have to pay $199 for wiring which is really expensive! I am not able to afford that and not really sure if that will make my speeds any better than what I am pay for right not.",

That was in October 2018 and now I am told they will never bring fiber down my road. Spectrum has a fiber line ran in front of my home (and 6 others) to one resident at the end of the road that paid $25k to have them run it.  In the process, they cut the AT&T DSL lines to our homes and left us without internet for over a month. Additionally, Spectrum failed to build a full infrastructure for multiple homes and did not offer the service to anyone else on the road. I have had them out to tell me what it would take to connect and they are quoting all of the homeowners on our road $11,800. The basis of the cost is because they did not install enough power supply to serve more than one home when they installed the fiber lines.",
    "survey_story": "After COVID happened, my employer required all employees to work from home. We now are being told that this will be the normal going forward and the offices will not reopen. This is a career and company I have worked in for 14 years. Additionally, my son is now forced to take all classes online because schools are not reopening. We are paying for 5mbps service but at best we get 2-4mbps at any given time. We've had three different routers, 8 different tech visits and there is no hope for us unless we go into debt to pay Spectrum. As a single mother, with a child entering college in the next two years, I do not have $11,800 just sitting around to spend on internet. Spectrum should have never been allowed to run fiber service down a residential road without building the infrastructure for all the homes and offering residents the opportunity to switch from AT&T DSL to their service.",
